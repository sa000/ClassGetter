# ClassGetter

To run install, latest version of webscrapy.

1) CD into into the ClassGetter folder
2) Run in terminal, scrapy crawl overall -o overall.csv . The 'overall' spider extracts all the courses and saves as a csv
2) run scrapy crawl prof -o prof.csv and gets all the professors, and extracts as a csv.


Improvements needed. a 2nd column is needed to be displayed their respective department.

This needs to be saved a json for data conversion.  a csv files and json should be outputted depending on which we need .
